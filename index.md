## Overview

Many volunteers often want to help more in their communities but can’t find opportunities or never hear back after applying. Our web application, Voluntree, is designed to facilitate and streamline the process of finding and engaging in volunteer opportunities. Our goal is to empower individuals to impact their communities by enhancing the volunteer experience.

## User Guide

This section provides a walkthrough of the Voluntree user interface and its capabilities.

### Landing Page

The landing page is presented to users when they visit the top-level URL to the site.

### Index pages (Projects, Profiles, Interests)

Bowfolios provides three public pages that present the contents of the database organized in various ways.

The Profiles page shows all the current defined profiles and their associated Projects and Interests:

![](images/profiles-page.png)

The Projects page shows all the currently defined Projects and their associated Profiles and Interests:

![](images/projects-page.png)

Finally, the Interests page shows all the currently defined Interests, and their associated Profiles and Projects:

![](images/interests-page.png)


### Sign in and sign up

Click on the "Login" button in the upper right corner of the navbar, then select "Sign in" to go to the following page and login. You must have been previously registered with the system to use this option:

Alternatively, you can select "Sign up" to go to the following page and register as a new user:

### Home page

After logging in, you are taken to the home page, which presents a form where you can complete and/or update your personal profile:

## Developer Guide

This section provides information of interest to Meteor developers wishing to use this code base as a basis for their own development tasks.

### Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, visit the [Bowfolios application github page](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios), and click the "Use this template" button to create your own repository initialized with a copy of this application. Alternatively, you can download the sources as a zip file or make a fork of the repo.  However you do it, download a copy of the repo to your local computer.

Third, cd into the bowfolios/app directory and install libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Fourth, run the system with:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

If all goes well, the application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Application Design

Bowfolios is based upon [meteor-application-template-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/) and [meteor-example-form-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-example-form-react/). Please use the videos and documentation at those sites to better acquaint yourself with the basic application design and form processing in Bowfolios.


## Initialization

The [config](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/tree/main/config) directory is intended to hold settings files.  The repository contains one file: [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/main/config/settings.development.json).

This file contains default definitions for Profiles, Projects, and Interests and the relationships between them. Consult the walkthrough video for more details.

The settings.development.json file contains a field called "loadAssetsFile". It is set to false, but if you change it to true, then the data in the file app/private/data.json will also be loaded.  The code to do this illustrates how to initialize a system when the initial data exceeds the size limitations for the settings file.


### Quality Assurance

#### ESLint

BowFolios includes a [.eslintrc](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/main/app/.eslintrc) file to define the coding style adhered to in this application. You can invoke ESLint from the command line as follows:

```
meteor npm run lint
```

Here is sample output indicating that no ESLint errors were detected:

```
$ meteor npm run lint

> bowfolios@ lint /Users/philipjohnson/github/bowfolios/bowfolios/app
> eslint --quiet --ext .jsx --ext .js ./imports ./tests

$
```

ESLint should run without generating any errors.

It's significantly easier to do development with ESLint integrated directly into your IDE (such as IntelliJ).

#### End to End Testing

BowFolios uses [TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/) to provide automated end-to-end testing.

The BowFolios end-to-end test code employs the page object model design pattern.  In the [bowfolios tests/ directory](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/tree/main/app/tests), the file [tests.testcafe.js](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/main/app/tests/tests.testcafe.js) contains the TestCafe test definitions. The remaining files in the directory contain "page object models" for the various pages in the system (i.e. Home, Landing, Interests, etc.) as well as one component (navbar). This organization makes the test code shorter, easier to understand, and easier to debug.

To run the end-to-end tests in development mode, you must first start up a BowFolios instance by invoking `meteor npm run start` in one console window.

Then, in another console window, start up the end-to-end tests with:

```
meteor npm run testcafe
```

You will see browser windows appear and disappear as the tests run.  If the tests finish successfully, you should see the following in your second console window:

```
$ meteor npm run testcafe

> bowfolios@ testcafe /Users/philipjohnson/github/bowfolios/bowfolios/app
> testcafe chrome tests/*.testcafe.js

 Running tests in:
 - Chrome 86.0.4240.111 / macOS 10.15.7

 Bowfolios localhost test with default db
 ✓ Test that landing page shows up
 ✓ Test that signin and signout work
 ✓ Test that signup page, then logout works
 ✓ Test that profiles page displays
 ✓ Test that interests page displays
 ✓ Test that projects page displays
 ✓ Test that home page display and profile modification works
 ✓ Test that addProject page works
 ✓ Test that filter page works


 9 passed (40s)

 $
```

You can also run the testcafe tests in "continuous integration mode".  This mode is appropriate when you want to run the tests using a continuous integration service like Jenkins, Semaphore, CircleCI, etc.  In this case, it is problematic to already have the server running in a separate console, and you cannot have the browser window appear and disappear.

<!-- To run the testcafe tests in continuous integration mode, first ensure that BowFolios is not running in any console.

Then, invoke `meteor npm run testcafe-ci`.  You will not see any windows appear.  When the tests finish, the console should look like this: -->

<!-- ## Continuous Integration -->

<!-- ![ci-badge](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/workflows/ci-bowfolios/badge.svg) -->
<!-- 
BowFolios uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) to automatically run ESLint and TestCafe each time a commit is made to the default branch.  You can see the results of all recent "workflows" at [https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/actions](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/actions).

The workflow definition file is quite simple and is located at
[.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Development History

The development process for BowFolios conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f19/modules/project-management/) practices. In a nutshell:

* Development consists of a sequence of Milestones.
* Each Milestone is specified as a set of tasks.
* Each task is described using a GitHub Issue, and is assigned to a single developer to complete.
* Tasks should typically consist of work that can be completed in 2-4 days.
* The work for each task is accomplished with a git branch named "issue-XX", where XX is replaced by the issue number.
* When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged into master.
* The state (todo, in progress, complete) of each task for a milestone is managed using a GitHub Project Board.

The following sections document the development history of BowFolios. -->

### Milestone 1: Mockup development

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system.

Milestone 1 was managed using [Voluntree GitHub Project Board M1](github.com/orgs/team-four-ics414/projects/1/views/1):
